# Programming_Assignment-1
Description:
I divided the problem into five parts and created five different functions in my program.
In the main function: I read the two DNA sequence files and took all the user defined inputs.
I used the try/except blocks for possible errors in the user inputs. 
I also checked the DNA sequences whether all the characters are neucliotides or not. 
I called the function "match_shift" to match the sequences.
