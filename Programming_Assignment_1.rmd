# Programming_Assignment-1
Description:
I divided the problem into five parts and created five different functions in my program.

In the main function: 
I read the two DNA sequence files and took all the user defined inputs.
I used the try/except blocks for possible errors in the user inputs. 
I also checked the DNA sequences whether all the characters are neucliotides or not. 
I called the function "match_shift" to match the sequences.

In the match_shift function:
Four arguments: the two DNA sequences, the maximum number of shifts (defined by the user) and 
a Boolean(to pass weather to check the contiguous match or not) is passed to the function.
