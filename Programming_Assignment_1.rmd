# Programming_Assignment-1
Description:
I divided the problem into five parts and created five different functions in my program.

In the main function: 
I read the two DNA sequence files and took all the user defined inputs.
I used the try/except blocks for possible errors in the user inputs. 
I also checked the DNA sequences whether all the characters are neucliotides or not. 
I called the function "match_shift" to match the sequences.

In the match_shift function:
Four arguments: the two DNA sequences, the maximum number of shifts (defined by the user) and 
a Boolean(to pass weather to check the contiguous match or not) is passed to the function.
This function calls three other functions: 'simple_match', 'contiguous_match', 'output_sequence'.

Matching Process: 
At first, the two sequences are compared (without any shift) and 
the number of matches are stored as 'current_score' and 'maximum_score'. 
Then one sequence is shifted by one place and compared with the other one. 
In each case, the match is stored in the current_score and compared with the maximum_score.
If current_score is greater or equal than the maxuimum_score then the maximum_score is updated and the 
respective two sequences are traced.
To find the maximum chain, the two sequences are checked and kept trace the maximum contiguous number.
